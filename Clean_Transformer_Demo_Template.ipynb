        "This is a template for a clean, first principles implementation of GPT-2 in PyTorch. This is an accompaniment to [my video tutorial on implementing GPT-2](https://neelnanda.io/transformer-tutorial-2). If you want to properly understand how to implement GPT-2, you'll need to do it yourself! **I recommend filling out this template *as* you watch the video, and seeing how far you can get with each section before watching me do it**. Each section comes with tests, so you can check that you got it right. You can see [a solution notebook here](https://www.neelnanda.io/transformer-solution) - use it if you get stuck, but make an attempt first, and no copying and pasting!\n",

The scientific name of the species refers to its size, being a pun on the word minuscule. It is very small, measuring only 8.4 to 10.8 mm (0.33 to 0.43 in) in snout–vent length. It has bronze underparts with a brown groin and back of the thigh, cream upperparts with brown flecking, a dark brown side of the head, and a red iris. On the hind feet, the first toe is absent and the second and fifth toes are strongly reduced. The frog is known only from the Sainte Luce Reserve, where it inhabits areas with deep leaf litter near semi-permanent water bodies. Specimens of frogs from Mandena, the Vohimena mountains, the southern Anosy Mountains, and Tsitongambarika may also be of this species. Along with Mini mum and Mini ature, the other two species in its genus, it received media attention when first described due to the wordplay in its scientific name. (Full article...)\"\"\""
